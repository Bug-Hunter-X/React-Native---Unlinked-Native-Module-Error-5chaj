This error occurs when you use a third-party library that has native modules and those modules are not correctly linked to your React Native project. This can happen due to issues in the build process or incorrect configuration of the native modules.

**Example:**

```javascript
import { MyNativeModule } from 'react-native-my-native-module';

MyNativeModule.someNativeMethod().then(() => {
  //Success
}).catch((error) => {
  // Handle error
});
```

If `react-native-my-native-module` isn't properly linked, this code might throw an error like `MyNativeModule is undefined` or a similar error indicating the native module is unavailable.
