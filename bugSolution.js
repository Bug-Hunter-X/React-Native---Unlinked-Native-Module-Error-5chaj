To solve this, you need to correctly link the native modules to your project. The exact steps depend on your native module and build system, but generally involves using commands like `react-native link` (if the library supports it) or manually linking the native code in your Android and iOS projects. 

**Example (using react-native link):**

1.  Install the native module package. 
```bash
 npm install react-native-my-native-module --save
```
2. Link the library using the react-native link command
```bash
 react-native link react-native-my-native-module
```
3. If that doesn't work try the following: (Note that this might vary based on the specific native module instructions)

    * **Android:** Add necessary entries into `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/settings.gradle`, referencing the native module code.
    * **iOS:** Add the necessary frameworks and libraries to your Xcode project, modifying the `ios/{projectName}.xcodeproj` project settings. 

4. Rebuild your React Native app.  

Ensure you've followed all the linking instructions in the third-party library's documentation. If the problem persists, check for errors in your build logs.
